# Rust-rsa
## This is an implementation of the RSA algorithm in Rust.

### DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A PERSONAL PROJECT JUST FOR FUN. DO NOT USE THIS LIBRARY ON PRODUCTION ENVOIRMENTS SINCE IS NOT DESIGNED FOR THAT KIND OF PURPOSES

TODO:
- [x] Generate big numbers of 1024 bits and 2048 bits.
- [ ] Implement modular exponentiation operation for Rabin-Miller algorithm.
- [ ] Implement Rabin Miller algorithm.
- [ ] Generate valid KeyPairs of a deterministic lenght.
- [ ] Encrypt messages with Public Key.
- [ ] Decrypt messages with Secret Key.
- [ ] Sign messages.
